# **How did you solve the problem?**
First, for me to understand the problem and what I had to do, I started by executing the Python code in repl.it. Once I knew the basics on one side, then I searched for similar commands that would work with my program in F#.
At the same time, I was looking for commands, I went ahead with the coding and included all that I was looking for. As a result of this, I ended up with some problems such as wrong or false declarations that did not even exist in the F# language. Despite of random errors, all the rest of it was easy and not time consuming.
# **Commands for executing operations**
-	not	Boolean negation
-	||	Boolean OR
-	&&	Boolean AND
# **Problems and solutions during the work’s programming**
My only issue with during the programming was the inclusive or. At first, I did not remember what that was, but with a little of investigation I ended up knowing that was equal to a XOR operation. F# do not accept such operation, hence I used the decomposed formula which uses OR, NOT and AND logic.
# **Is it a NP or P complexity?**
Because the code includes a set of chained FORs, it indicates O(n²) for the complexity. Hence, the complexity will be polynomial.
