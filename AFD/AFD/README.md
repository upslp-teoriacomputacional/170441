# **How did you solve the problem?**
First, for me to understand the problem and what I had to do, I started by executing the Python code in repl.it. Once I knew the basics on one side, then I searched for similar commands that would work with my program in F#.
At the same time, I was looking for commands, I went ahead with the coding and included all that I was looking for. As a result of this, I ended up with some problems such as wrong or false declarations that did not even exist in the F# language. Despite of random errors, all the rest of it was easy and not time consuming.
# **Commands for executing operations**
-	mutable	The mutable keyword allows you to declare and assign values in a mutable variable.
-	match		Pattern matching is used for control flow.
-	Console.ReadLine()	Reads the next line of characters from the standard input stream.
-	<>		Returns true if the left side is not equal to the right side; otherwise, returns false.	
# **Problems and solutions during the work’s programming**
This time, the main issue was the programming language itself. F# provides a good structure to build a comparison for the character, but in other aspects it will give you a hard time trying to find something more specific. For example, one of my problems was variables because I did no know that you could use mutable in order to alter the value assigned without having to declare it a second time.
# **Is it a NP or P complexity?**
Because the code includes a search, it indicates O(n²) for the complexity. Hence, the complexity will be polynomial.
